                </p>

                <p><strong>Why is this medication prescribed?</strong></p>
                Abacavir is used along with other medications to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
                Abacavir is in a class of medications called nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). 
                It works by decreasing the amount of HIV in the blood. 
                Although abacavir does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer.
                Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other lifestyle changes may decrease the risk of transmitting (spreading) the HIV virus to other people.
              </p>

                <p><strong>How should this medicine be used?</strong></p>
                Abacavir comes as a tablet and a solution (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken once or twice daily with or without food.
                Take abacavir at around the same time(s) every day. 
                Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.
                Take abacavir exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
              </p>
              Abacavir helps to control HIV infection but does not cure it. Continue to take abacavir even if you feel well.
              Do not stop taking abacavir without talking to your doctor.
               If you stop taking abacavir or skip doses, your condition may become more difficult to treat, or you could have an allergic reaction when restarting the medication.
               Do not run out of medication. When your supply of abacavir starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist.
            </p>
                <p><strong>Other uses for this medicine</strong><p></p> 
              </ul>
                Abacavir is also used in combination with other antiviral medications to prevent HIV infection in people who have been exposed to it.
                Talk to your doctor about the possible risks of using this medication for your condition.</p>
                This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</p>

                <p>pronounced as (a bal" oh par' a tide)</p>
                <p><strong>Why is this medication prescribed?</strong></p>
                Abaloparatide injection is used to treat osteoporosis (condition in which the bones become thin and weak and break easily)
                in women who have undergone menopause ('change in life,' end of menstrual periods),
                who are at high risk of fractures (broken bones) (history of fracture from osteoporosis or multiple risk factors for fracture)
                or who have failed or not tolerated other medications. Abaloparatide injection is also used to treat osteoporosis in men
                who are at high risk of fracture or who have failed or not tolerated other medications.
                Abaloparatide injection contains a synthetic form of a natural human hormone called parathyroid hormone (PTH).
                It works by causing the body to build new bone and by increasing bone strength and density (thickness).</p>
                
                <p><strong>How should this medicine be used?</strong></p>
                Abaloparatide injection comes as a solution (liquid) to inject subcutaneously (under the skin).
                It is usually given once a day. Use abaloparatide injection at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully,
                and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use abaloparatide injection exactly as directed.
                Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.</p>
                <p>Abaloparatide injection comes in a pen that contains enough medication for 30 doses. Do not transfer the medication to another syringe.
                  Dispose of your pen 30 days after first opening even if it still contains unused medication.
                </p>
                <p>You should inject abaloparatide injection into the lower stomach area. Avoid giving your injection within the 2-inch area around your belly button. Talk to your doctor about how to change your injection site for each injection. Do not give abaloparatide injection into your veins or muscles. Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, scaly, hard, or where you have scars or stretch marks.</p>
                <p>You should know that abaloparatide injection may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting when you get up too quickly from a lying position as well as a fast or pounding heartbeat and nausea. This usually occurs within 4 hours after receiving your dose and generally goes away within a few hours. You should receive your first several doses of abaloparatide injection where you can sit or lie down right away if necessary.</p>
                <p>Your doctor may recommend calcium and vitamin D supplements to take during your treatment.</p>
                <p>Abaloparatide injection controls osteoporosis but does not cure it. Continue to use abaloparatide injection even if you feel well. Do not stop using abaloparatide injection without talking to your doctor.</p>
                 <p><strong>Other uses for this medicine</strong><p></p> 
              </ul>
                This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.</p>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>What side effects can this medication cause?</strong></p>>
              Abaloparatide injection may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>dizziness</li>
                <li>sense of spinning</li>
